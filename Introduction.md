## Introduction

### General populaton & sample (Выборка и генеральная совокупность)

- **General population** - is a set of all objects that we are interested in.
- **Sample** - is a subset of general population.

### Sampling methods (Методы выборки)

![Sampling Methods](https://www.qualtrics.com/m/assets/uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/SystemicRandomSamplingRefresh_01-560x315_060722.png)

- **Simple random sampling** - is a method of sampling where each element of the population has an equal chance of being selected.
- **Stratified sampling** - is a method of sampling where the population is divided into groups (strata) and a random sample is selected from each group.
- **Cluster sampling** - is a method of sampling where the population is divided into groups (clusters) and a random sample is selected from each group.
- **Systematic sampling** - is a method of sampling where researchers select every kth element from the population.

### Types of variables. Quantitative & qualitative variables (Типы переменных. Количественные и качественные переменные)

#### Types of variables

- **Quantitative variables (качественные переменные)** - are variables that can be measured on a numerical scale. *(ex. height, weight, age, etc.)*
  - Discrete variables - are variables that can only take on certain values. *(ex. number of children, number of cars, etc.)*
  - Continuous variables - are variables that can take on any value within a range. *(ex. height, weight, age, etc.)*
- **Nominal variables** (qualitative, номинативные) - are variables that can be placed into categories, but the categories cannot be ordered or ranked. *(ex. ‘gender’)*

### Measures of central tendency (Меры центральной тенденции)

#### Glossary

**Emperical data** - is data that is collected by observation or experiment.

**Descriptive statistics** - is a branch of statistics that deals with the collection, organization, and presentation of data. It is used to summarize large amounts of information in a meaningful way.

Descriptive statistics is devided into two parts:
- **Measures of central tendency** - are measures that describe the center of a distribution.
  - **Mean (Среднее значение)** - is the sum of all values divided by the number of values.
  - **Median (Медиана)** - is the middle value in a sorted, ascending or descending, list of numbers.
  - **Mode (Мода)** - is the value that occurs most frequently in a set of data.
- **Measures of variability** - are measures that describe the spread of a distribution.
  - **Range (Размах)** - is the difference between the largest and smallest values in a data set.
  - **Variance (Дисперсия)** - is a measure of how spread out numbers are.
  - **Standard deviation (Стандартное отклонение)** - is a measure of how spread out numbers are.
  - **Coefficient of variation (Коэффициент вариации)** - is a measure of how spread out numbers are.
  - **Cumulative distribution function (Функция распределения)** - is a function that gives the probability that a variable takes a value less than or equal to x.
  - **Percentile (Процентиль)** - is a measure used in statistics indicating the value below which a given percentage of observations in a group of observations fall.
  - **Quartile (Квартиль)** - is a type of quantile, which is a measure used in statistics indicating the value below which a given percentage of observations in a group of observations fall.
  - **Interquartile range (Межквартильный размах)** - is a measure of statistical dispersion, being equal to the difference between 75th and 25th percentiles, or between upper and lower quartiles, IQR = Q3 − Q1.
  - **Outlier (Выброс)** - is an observation point that is distant from other observations.
  - **Skewness (Асимметрия)** - is a measure of the asymmetry of the probability distribution of a real-valued random variable about its mean.
  - **Kurtosis (Эксцесс)** - is a measure of whether the data are heavy-tailed or light-tailed relative to a normal distribution
  - **Normal distribution (Нормальное распределение)** - is a type of continuous probability distribution for a real-valued random variable.
  - **Standard normal distribution (Стандартное нормальное распределение)** - is a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
  - **Z-score (Z-оценка)** - is the signed number of standard deviations by which the value of an observation or data point is above the mean value of what is being observed or measured.
  - **Probability distribution (Распределение вероятностей)** - is a function that gives the probabilities of occurrence of different possible outcomes in an experiment. Or, in other words, it is a function that describes the possible values that a random variable can take and the corresponding probabilities of these values.
  - **Probability density function (Функция плотности вероятности или гистограмма частот)** - is a function that describes the relative likelihood for this value or any value around it to be drawn from the population.
