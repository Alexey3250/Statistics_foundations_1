    "### General populaton & sample (Выборка и генеральная совокупность)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **General population** - is a set of all objects that we are interested in.\n",
    "- **Sample** - is a subset of general population.\n",
    "\n",
    "Population & sample \n",

    "\n",
    "- **Simple random sampling** - is a method of sampling where each element of the population has an equal chance of being selected.\n",
    "- **Stratified sampling** - is a method of sampling where the population is divided into groups (strata) and a random sample is selected from each group.\n",
    "- **Cluster sampling** - is a method of sampling where the population is divided into groups (clusters) and a random sample is selected from each group.\n",
    "- **Systematic sampling** - is a method of sampling where researchers select every kth element from the population.\n",

    "### Types of variables. Quantitative & qualitative variables (Типы переменных. Количественные и качественные переменные)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Types of variables\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Quantitative variables (качественные переменные)** - are variables that can be measured on a numerical scale. *(ex. height, weight, age, etc.)*\n",
    "  - Discrete variables - are variables that can only take on certain values. *(ex. number of children, number of cars, etc.)*\n",
    "  - Continuous variables - are variables that can take on any value within a range. *(ex. height, weight, age, etc.)*\n",
    "- **Nominal variables** (qualitative, номинативные) - are variables that can be placed into categories, but the categories cannot be ordered or ranked. *(ex. ‘gender’)*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Measures of central tendency (Меры центральной тенденции)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Glossary\n",
    "\n",
    "**Emperical data** - is data that is collected by observation or experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Descriptive statistics** - is a branch of statistics that deals with the collection, organization, and presentation of data. It is used to summarize large amounts of information in a meaningful way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Descriptive statistics is devided into two parts:\n",
    "- **Measures of central tendency** - are measures that describe the center of a distribution.\n",
    "  - **Mean (Среднее значение)** - is the sum of all values divided by the number of values.\n",
    "  - **Median (Медиана)** - is the middle value in a sorted, ascending or descending, list of numbers.\n",
    "  - **Mode (Мода)** - is the value that occurs most frequently in a set of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Measures of variability** - are measures that describe the spread of a distribution.\n",
    "  - **Range (Размах)** - is the difference between the largest and smallest values in a data set.\n",
    "  - **Variance (Дисперсия)** - is a measure of how spread out numbers are.\n",
    "  - **Standard deviation (Стандартное отклонение)** - is a measure of how spread out numbers are.\n",
    "  - **Coefficient of variation (Коэффициент вариации)** - is a measure of how spread out numbers are.\n",
    "  - **Cumulative distribution function (Функция распределения)** - is a function that gives the probability that a variable takes a value less than or equal to x.\n",
    "  - **Percentile (Процентиль)** - is a measure used in statistics indicating the value below which a given percentage of observations in a group of observations fall.\n",
    "  - **Quartile (Квартиль)** - is a type of quantile, which is a measure used in statistics indicating the value below which a given percentage of observations in a group of observations fall.\n",
    "  - **Interquartile range (Межквартильный размах)** - is a measure of statistical dispersion, being equal to the difference between 75th and 25th percentiles, or between upper and lower quartiles, IQR = Q3 − Q1.\n",
    "  - **Outlier (Выброс)** - is an observation point that is distant from other observations.\n",
    "  - **Skewness (Асимметрия)** - is a measure of the asymmetry of the probability distribution of a real-valued random variable about its mean.\n",
    "  - **Kurtosis (Эксцесс)** - is a measure of whether the data are heavy-tailed or light-tailed relative to a normal distribution\n",
    "  - **Normal distribution (Нормальное распределение)** - is a type of continuous probability distribution for a real-valued random variable.\n",
    "  - **Standard normal distribution (Стандартное нормальное распределение)** - is a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.\n",
    "  - **Z-score (Z-оценка)** - is the signed number of standard deviations by which the value of an observation or data point is above the mean value of what is being observed or measured.\n",
    "  - **Probability distribution (Распределение вероятностей)** - is a function that gives the probabilities of occurrence of different possible outcomes in an experiment. Or, in other words, it is a function that describes the possible values that a random variable can take and the corresponding probabilities of these values.\n",
    "  - **Probability density function (Функция плотности вероятности или гистограмма частот)** - is a function that describes the relative likelihood for this value or any value around it to be drawn from the population.\n",
